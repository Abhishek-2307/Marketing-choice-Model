# Marketing-choice-Model
People make choices everyday. They choose products like orange juice or a car, decide who to vote for, and choose how to get to work. Marketers, retailers, product designers, political scientists, transportation planners, sociologists, and many others want to understand what drives these choices. Choice models predict what people will choose as a function of the features of the options available and can be used to make important product design decisions.
